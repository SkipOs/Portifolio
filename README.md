# Portifolio
A site model that I made for a school project.
Altrought it is my first time with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, I'm pretty happy with the results so far.

I plan to also do a list with upcoming updates and "features" (if I can call it like that) to this template very soon.

# Milestones
- Posted the project in a GitHub Repository (26 jun 2021)
